Use React and Webpack to build static sites with hot reload and client-side page transitions.

### TODO

- [ ] Show clear errors if static generation fails; rebuild upon file save
- [ ] Multiple redux page selectors via reselect:
  - [ ] Flat map
  - [ ] Nested map/object by path
- [ ] Assign default permalink to page if none is provided as static property/frontmatter
