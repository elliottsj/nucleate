# nucleate

>*Nucleation is the first step in the formation of either a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure via self-assembly or self-organization.*

A static site generator powered by React and webpack.

### Why nucleate?
* Hot module replacement during development
* Instant client-side page transitions
* *It's just a webpack app&trade;*

### Why not [Gatsby][]?


### TODO

- [ ] Show clear errors if static generation fails; rebuild upon file save
- [ ] Multiple redux page selectors via reselect:
  - [ ] Flat map
  - [ ] Nested map/object by path
- [ ] Assign default permalink to page if none is provided as static property/frontmatter
